I"o<p>Yes and no. <strong>Yes</strong>, In my opinion designers should do whatever it takes to be able to collaborate well, including to communicate their concepts and ideas clearly.</p>

<p>If visualizing ideas through boxes and arrows of flowchart diagrams is what it takes, then do it. If code is what it takes, then learn to code.</p>

<p>Designers (including me in the past) are often confusing <em>crafts</em> with <em>tools</em>. Our shortcoming is we focused too much on tools, the discussion is often hinder us to be practical and actually get creative. As a designer we can think about code as one of the communication tools to prototype, to give shapes to our concepts and ideas so that people can see and try it before we invest more in developing it.</p>

<p>And <strong>no</strong>, maybe designers would like to be extra careful with production level code ✌️</p>
