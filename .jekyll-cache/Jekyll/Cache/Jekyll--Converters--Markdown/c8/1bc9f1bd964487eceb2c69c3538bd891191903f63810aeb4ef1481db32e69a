I"n<p>I thought this post will be a weekly thing. I read, watch, listen to stuff on the internet, then pick top 5 to be published along with my short review.</p>

<p>Today I realized that was not what I have in mind for <a href="/weblog">web-log</a> section. This section should be a living log on the web (hence web-log); harnessing web’s potential to be updated, edited, and published in seconds. Not a usual blog post.</p>

Only humans having similar struggles with us wherever we are.</p>
