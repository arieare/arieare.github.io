I"h<p>Yes and no. <strong>Yes</strong>, in my opinion designers should do whatever it takes to be able to collaborate well. Designers should do whatever it takes to communicate ideas and concepts more clearly. If visualizing ideas through boxes, arrows, and flowchart diagram is what it takes, then do it. If coding is what it takes, then learn to code.</p>

<p>Designers (including me in the past) are often confusing <em>crafts</em> with <em>tools</em>. Our shortcoming is we focused too much on tools. The discussion around tools often hinders us to be practical and get creative in the face of constraints.</p>

<p>It’s useful to see <em>code</em> as one of the communication tools, useful for prototyping and giving shapes to our concepts and ideas.</p>

<p>And <strong>no</strong>, maybe designers would like to be extra careful with production level code ✌️</p>
