I"$<p>Initially, I thought this post will be a weekly thing. I read, watch, listen to things on the internet, then pick top 5 to be published along with my short review. Today I realized this is not what I have in mind for <a href="/weblog">web-log</a> section. This section should be a living log on the web, not a usual blog post.</p>

<p>Originally <em>Media Consumption Report Week 14</em>, now this will be a curated section on this website where I will be adding links to article/video/podcast from the internet. This will be one of the my personal go-to references that I will occassionally re-visit and adding more notes as my interpretation of it also changes.</p>

<p><small>Article · Read 4 April 2020</small></p>

<p>An essay by Yuval Noah Harari, the author of Sapien and Homo Deus in his familiar style of writing. He shares his view about the current pandemic and laid out different scenarios that could happen.</p>

<p>Most of our everyday actions can be traced back to some form of signaling or status seeking. For example I’m sharing what media I consumed like this might not be purely for sharing a good read, but also a signaling action to make me look smart.</p>

<p>Julian posits that signaling can be monetized differently in a software, compared to a physical goods. Mainly the signal amplification part.</p>

Dian Sastro is back in the film industry, now as a producer. Lots of insights on how movie is using the language of empathy.

Only humans having similar struggles with us wherever we are.</p>
