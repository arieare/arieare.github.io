I"N<p>Initially, I thought this post will be a weekly thing. I read, watch, listen to things on the internet, then pick top 5 to be published along with my short review. Today I realized this is not what I have in mind for <a href="/weblog">web-log</a> section. This section should be a living log on the web, not a usual blog post.</p>
