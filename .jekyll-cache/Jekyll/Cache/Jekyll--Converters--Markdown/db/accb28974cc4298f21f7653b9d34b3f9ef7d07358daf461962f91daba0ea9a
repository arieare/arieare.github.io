<p>An essay by Yuval Noah Harari, the author of Sapien and Homo Deus in his familiar style of writing. He shares his view about the current pandemic and laid out different scenarios that could happen.</p>

<p>A test to citizenship, a choice between privacy and health, between nationality and global collaboration. <em>As usual sometimes it seems that he oversimplified things and make it look like there are only two choices.</em></p>

<p>The developer of the original Crash Bandicoot game (PlayStation) tell stories about how the game came to be. I find this interesting especially part where they said that they need to invent a new way to <em>exploit</em> the PlayStation’s memory to be able to fit in more detail in the game.</p>

<p>Dian Sastro is back in the film industry, now as a producer. Lots of insights on how movie is using the language of empathy. For example, no matter when you watched a Swedish indie movie, Korean drama, or a blockbuster movie, you don’t see nationalities there. Only humans having similar struggles with us wherever we are.</p>
