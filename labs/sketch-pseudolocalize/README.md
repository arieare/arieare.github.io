# Sketch Pseudolocalize
Pseudolocalization is a method to test the internationalization of text while maintaining readability. The purpose of this testing is to expose issues regarding length and flow of text, layout issues and logic issues.

If you are getting translations done externally it can be a time consuming and expensive process so localization testing should take place long before you get any kind of translator involved. By verifying everything is correct you will save time and iterations back and forth with translators.
