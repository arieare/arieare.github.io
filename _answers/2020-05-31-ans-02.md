question: How do you protect this ask form from spam or repeated request attack?

I simply don't ðŸ˜… This form is powered by a Google Form. Here's how it works: when you click the **Ask Away** button, it will submit the question to a dedicated Google Form. If it's an empty submission, it will be rejected. The submitted questions then will be forwarded to a Google Sheet. From there, I can filter out nonsensical and spammy questions.

In fact, this is an opportunity to make the process transparent. So here it is, the [link to the submitted anonymous questions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cQCIXfKOgDbAhBcd2cHjWu1Yp4LiHAh27H6nhtzS5j4/edit#gid=714719919){:target="_blank"} (viewer access).
