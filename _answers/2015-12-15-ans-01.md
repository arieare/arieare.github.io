question: What if you can't let go of the past? Even when you've tried so hard.
qnaid: let-go-of-the-past

The past is in our head, there is no physical extra-dimensional place that we can – and need – to lookback too often. One of the best advice I've got is to try being present. At this point of time there is no past, just "if only". There is no future either, only "what if(s)".
