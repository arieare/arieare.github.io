		<p>It's 2020, a particularly weird year in my lifetime.</p>

		<p>Re-starting a web-log is part of my yearly theme, <em>deliberation</em>. I plan this web-log to help me structuring my thoughts, especially when putting ideas out to the internet in a more deliberated way. Blog is out of fashion? I don't care.</p>

		<p>I'm currently interested in the world of <strong>mechanical keyboards</strong>. Initially I thought it's just a simple clackity-clack, boy am I wrong.</p>
			
		<p>It's started with a humble beginning of <em>“ah, my wireless keyboard was left in the office, I should find a replacement.”</em> Now I'm down in a rabbit hole to understand <a href="https://www.mechanical-keyboard.org/switch-types/" target="_blank">different types of switches</a> that I can choose.</p>
			
		<p>If you happen to be an owner of mechanical keyboards (according to <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/ZPRwOqR" target="_blank">r/mechanicalkeyboards survey</a> some people hoard up to 100 of this thing), recommend me one <a href="https://twitter.com/arieare" target="_blank">or just talk to me about it</a>.</p>

		<p>On a slightly different topic, I'm currently working as a Design Lead at <a href="https://www.traveloka.com/en/" target="_blank">Traveloka</a>. After years of being an individual contributor designer, I'm now treading the rope of design leadership. If you have a similar journey I'd love to discuss it with you.</p>

		<p>I'm currently living in the outskirt of Jakarta, Indonesia. Although, at this point of time the whereabouts of a person might be irrelevant to be able to stay connected.</p>
		
		<p>We've been in a self-quarantine for more than a month now due to a global pandemic caused by <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus#tab=tab_1" target="_blank">COVID-19</a>. Most people stay at home trying to <em><a href="https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-flatten-the-curve.html" target="_blank">flatten the curve</a></em> by inhibiting the spread of the virus.</p>

		<p>Some of us cope with this situation by playing a <em>suspiciously-timely</em> released game called <a href="https://animal-crossing.com/" target="_blank">Animal Crossing</a>. For me, I've been trying to master the <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/crash-team-racing-nitro-fueled/Papu's_Pyramid" target="_blank">Papu's Pyramid</a> track on <em>Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled</em>. I swear now I could draw the track without any references from turn-to-turn.</p>
		
		<p>It's 2020, a particularly weird year in my lifetime. I'm sure a lot of people at least agree with it to some extent.</p>
