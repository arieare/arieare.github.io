		 <p>The idea behind web-log might be a bit different than a typical blog post. While happen to be public, this space meant to be a way to help me structuring my thoughts through writings.</p>
		 <p>Here you may find old notes got updated and reiterated as I gain more informations or as my perspective changes. Thus the list below will also sorted based on posts (new or old) that recently get updated.</p>
	  <aside class="weblog-post-card">
		<small>Updated {{ post.date | date_to_string }}</small>
		<h3><a href="{{ post.url }}" title="{{ post.title }}">{{ post.title }}</a></h3>
